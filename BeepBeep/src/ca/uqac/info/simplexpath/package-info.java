 * Package for handling of simple XML documents and simple XPath queries.
 * Although Java provides classes for handling XML documents and XPath
 * queries, they have been found to be slow for monitoring purposes.
 * Within the limits of the current package (see the
 * documentation for {@link Element} and {@link SimpleXPathExpression},
 * the present classes have been found to run 8-10 times faster than
 * the JDK classes for the same queries.
